# TheYard
A website pitch to the creators of the Yard Podcast.  Implemented front-end development skills learned in college to pitch a website to get involved in my friends' activities in their creation of the Yard.  More of a personal project, but I coordinated with Ludwig and Slime to ask what they were looking for in a potential home page for their podcast.
